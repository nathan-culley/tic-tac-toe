This is my solution to the tic-tac-toe project for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).

To-Do List:

- Add option to input names
    - Add name variables to be associated with X and O, and add event listeners to the buttons to change those variables.
- Reset first player to X with each new game
- Add styling
- Add AI for player to play against
- Fix victory check to make sure the right player is being declared winner.
